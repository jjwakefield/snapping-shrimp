# Snapping Shrimp

A stochastic model for simulating the acoustic signature of snapping shrimp noise (SSN).

This project implements a physically-motivated model to generate time series of SSN. It captures the characteristic "bursty" and "heavy-tailed" nature of the noise by modelling snap timing (NHPP), individual waveforms, and amplitude (SÎ±S distributions) based on environmental cycles. An interactive infographic visualises the model's components and final output.
