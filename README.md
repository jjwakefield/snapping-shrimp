# snapping-shrimp
This project implements a physically-motivated model to generate realistic time series of snapping shrimp noise (SSN). It captures the characteristic "bursty" and "heavy-tailed" nature of SSN by modeling snap timing, waveform, and amplitude based on environmental factors and specific statistical distributions.
